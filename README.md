|1|Write a C program to check if a given number is Fibonacci number|Link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_01_Bhoomi.c|
|2|Write a C program to generate Pascal Triangle using array.|Link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_02_Bhoomi.c|
|3|Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in ascending order of roll list.|Link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_03_Bhoomi.c|
|4|Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in descending order of percentange.|Link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_04_Bhoomi.c|
|5|Write a C program to find largest element in an array|Link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_05_Bhoomi.c|
|6|Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY 1. INSERT 2. DELETE 3. TRAVERSE 4. SEARCH|link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_06_Bhoomi.c|
|7|Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the following operations: 1. Input new time 2. Display the time 3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.)|link:https://github.com/Bhoomi-Landge/DSA_Programs/blob/main/33_07_Bhoomi.c|
